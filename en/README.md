The married life of the golden couple Bi Rain - Kim Tae Hee is something of great concern to the public. After revealing the first floor of a hundred-billion-dollar villa last week, this time, Bi Rain continued to reveal the kitchen and space of the two daughters through The Manager broadcast on the evening of March 7.

The kitchen in Bi Rain's hundred billion villa is particularly impressive with a minimalist yet luxurious design, with main black and gray tones, many modern and expensive equipment. The male singer proudly boasted: "I personally designed the interior of the whole nest". Besides, he also revealed a part of the space of 2 girls. The father of two has installed a railing at the corner of the staircase to ensure absolute safety for the children, and the toys of the two daughters are also neatly arranged in the crib.

Also in this program, Bi Rain showed his talent to cook fried rice and crab for beautiful wife Kim Tae Hee and her children. The father of two is very capable, proficient in cooking and has quickly finished dishes. After he finished cooking, he called the whole family down to eat, but there was no response. The famous male singer explained that because his wife and children were very shy and did not want to appear on television, so he would turn off the camera here.
